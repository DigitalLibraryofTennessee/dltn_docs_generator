Crossroads to Freedom - XOAI Mapping
====================================

-----
About
-----

In Fall 2018, Crossroads to Freedom's old Fedora 2 instance crashed. This caused DLTN to lose approximate 117,000
records mapped to DPLA. This is an attempt to try to re-add this collection by mapping the migrated objects from DSPACE
to DPLA as XOAI.

**Note**:  To simplify the migration, Rhodes decided to change the content models of some of their objects.  For
instance, the Memphis World collection was online originally with article level metadata.  The migrated collection
does not have article level metadata, and thus has over 100,000 fewer metadata records.

Sets to Map

Here is a list of the sets that were migrated from the old Crossroads to DSPACE.
