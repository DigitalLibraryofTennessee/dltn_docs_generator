Reharvesting Sets
=================

By default, the Digital Library of Tennessee does not automatically reharvest sets.  Over the years, we have found that
local practices vary greatly and that automatic reharvests aren't always possible for providers.  Instead, normal practice
is for providers to request reharvests of existing sets via the `DLTN XSLT issue tracker <https://github.com/DigitalLibraryofTennessee/DLTN_XSLT/issues>`_
or through the `TennShare Existing Partner Update Form <https://www.tenn-share.org/survey/TakeSurvey.asp?PageNumber=1&SurveyID=51M683LL5726M>`_.

**Note**:  automatic reharvests are available.  If you have a set that you'd like to have automatically reharvested, open
an issue on the `DLTN XSLT issue tracker <https://github.com/DigitalLibraryofTennessee/DLTN_XSLT/issues>`_.
