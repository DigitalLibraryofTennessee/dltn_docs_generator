Individual provider reports are generated automatically based on data from:

* Repox with `pyrepox <https://github.com/markpbaggett/pyrepox>`_
* `The DLTN MODS OAI Feed <https://dpla.lib.utk.edu/repox/OAIHandler?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=MODS>`_
* sets in DPLA ingest's `TN mapper <https://github.com/dpla/ingestion/blob/develop/profiles/tn.pjs>`_

When this repository is updated, new versions of these reports are pushed automatically to `readthedocs <https://dltn-technical-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#current-providers>`_.
